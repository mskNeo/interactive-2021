  <h1>The Web As An Amusement Park</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Web is available to all (who can afford an internet connection).</strong> Cash rules everything around us.</li>
      <li><strong>The Web is divided into many different areas.</strong> Some are cool, like Youtube, but others are weird, like Youtube.</li>
      <li><strong>Every journey through the Web is different.</strong> I can't tell you how many times I've gotten lost in the Web (or an amusement park)</li>
      <li><strong>People will always be trying to coax you into spending your money.</strong> I, myself, have spent $2,320 on the Web (and an amusement park) so be careful kids.</li>
      <li><strong>People make a lot of memories on the Web, for better and for worse.</strong> Either way, you'll be thinking about it for a week straight then forget it suddenly.</li>
      <li><strong>The Web is a public place where you get to meet people.</strong> They may or may not want to talk to you though.</li>
